STRUCTURE
================

This charm operates a bit out of the norm compared to other charms in that it
spans a great many topics. Aside from the standard directories there are three
additional directories. A high level overview of their contents and functions
are outlined below. For more indepth information please refer to the header in
each file.

+ opt/
  This holds all the misc files for each game, typically the sever file and any
  related system files for Apache, etc are stored here. When needed they will be
  copied to their respective locations and updated to reflect the appropriate
  configuration options

+ env/
  Each game has it's own ENV file which sets up game specific variables needed
  during install and runtime of the game. These are "hardcoded" values based
  on best practices for deploying each game to allow for multiple
  deployments without duplication of effort
